# Covid analysis with Power BI 
This repo was designed to show how to present information in the Power BI platform.
The data is colected direclty from the <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/"> WorldMeter</a> website about the covid-19 outbreak.

Trough the .pbix file it is possible to navigate, filter, and investigate the data by country, region, making it easy to understand the whole situation behind the data.

Lets take a look on a table by country. Some columns are built using the Dax language, like the % of cases and deaths over population.
<img src = "Country Table.png" alt = "Country Table" height = "550" width = "870"/>
      
Now, lets see the kpis ploted in maps, which is more visually friendly than a table.      
<img src = "map kpis.png" alt = "Map Kpis" height = "550" width = "870"/>
 
We also can analyze the correlation between cases and deaths by 1 million population
<img src = "correlation between dates and cases.png" alt = "Correlation" height = "550" width = "870"/>
      
Finnaly we can take a look on how data is been architectured in the platform using Dax.

<img src = "dax1.png" alt = "Dax1" height = "450" width = "1170"/>

<img src = "dax2.png" alt = "Dax2" height = "450" width = "1170"/>
